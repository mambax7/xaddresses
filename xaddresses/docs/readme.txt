Read Me First
=============
To create a new module, use at first tab Modules in admin and fill in all required fields for the information and variables to be included in the name, description, and everything will be written in the file xoops_version.php.

If you need to add a database, you must navigate to the tab Tables to enter a first name, number and image fields.
The next step will serve to create individual fields in the table.

Concluded the number of tables you can move on to building tab.

Once built the module, to be able to copy and paste in the folder modules on the web space where xoops is installed, you must go to the folder TDMCreate/modules, here you will find all modules created and saved.

Note: It's always recommended to try local first, might have new modules of code not working.
